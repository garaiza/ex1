                                <p>Trello is a website that is used for collaborative projects. The user is able to leave notes, contact certain people, upload files and remove files, and create new projects. Trello is a really good website as it allows users to see everything that everyone is doing, which allows for easy communication between team members, which is very important when there are multiple parties involved in a project.</p>

                                <p>The user interaction is very much based on sticky notes while maintaining a organizational filing system. Each list is a broad topic that the team member can see. Within that the user can add cards to the bottom in order to create subcategories. The team members can add files accordingly to each card or list to move the project along. The person is able to see if a task is done with list statuses that say completed, paused for input, and so forth. The right side is a thread of all the messages that have been written. </p>

                                <p>Overall Trello is a very easy site to use for collaborative projects. It does not get too crowded nor does it make everything hard to find. It is a very organized cite in terms of this type of usability. It alerts you through email when someone calls for you and finding where you are needed is also easy to find. Overall Trello has a very good system, it does what it is made to do.</p>

                            <img src="../images/tumblr.PNG" class="imageResize">
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Tumblr is a blogging website that allows users to create and share content with other users. The bloggers can share media such videos, audio files, pictures, links and text posts. Users can also create and design their own blog pages, which people can follow for content. Users can also communicate with each other through submissions, chat, asks and fan mail.</p>



                                <p>In terms of user friendliness, the scale is unfortunately not as great as it should be. The staff keeps changing graphic and UX/UI aspects that do not necessarily need changing. They try to hide menus and change button designs to be more minimalistic, but do not help in terms of usability. </p>

                                <p>In order to counter Tumblr&#8217;s useless updates, many people like myself, have downloaded extensions to help clean the mess. I personally use X-kit, which is a chrome extension that allows to customize my dashboard how I please. The screenshot of my dashboard shown above is not the same as it would be if you did not have X-kit. If I did not have this option, I would not recommend that you use Tumblr.</p>
