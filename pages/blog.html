                        <p>Tumblr is a blogging website that allows users to create and share content with other users. The bloggers can share media such videos, audio files, pictures, links and text posts. Users can also create and design their own blog pages, which people can follow for content. Users can also communicate with each other through submissions, chat, asks and fan mail.</p>



                        <p>In terms of user friendliness, the scale is unfortunately not as great as it should be. The staff keeps changing graphic and UX/UI aspects that do not necessarily need changing. They try to hide menus and change button designs to be more minimalistic, but do not help in terms of usability. </p>

                        <p>In order to counter Tumblr&#8217;s useless updates, many people like myself, have downloaded extensions to help clean the mess. I personally use X-kit, which is a chrome extension that allows to customize my dashboard how I please. The screenshot of my dashboard shown above is not the same as it would be if you did not have X-kit. If I did not have this option, I would not recommend that you use Tumblr.</p>
