                                <p>This is my interface I mae for excercise 3, Time is on my Side. I originally had 3 different designs in mind that were completely different. I wasn't really sure what I was doing until we got our sketches back and we saw some examples. I was particularly ispired by one that had dots and you could press the dots and the information would pop out. I had someething similar in one of them and so decided to update my design as well as combine elements from all 3 of my sketches into one solid design.</p>

                                <p>For the design itself I was really inspired by back-to-school imagery of blackboards and chalk. I also really wanted to add fun colors that would pop out from the black and have it seem more playful: "school can be fun." I think it is a fun way to interact with almost like a schedule on a chalkboard. </p>
                                
                    <p>In terms of interactivity, I have it so that you can focus on the times and numbers specifically on what area you want to look at. When you hover over the pink button you get a percentage and the name of what it is in a hover. When you only want to see those, you can click on it and it shows the percentage of the time you spent doing that. You can click of them however much yo want. If you want specifics for a time, you click on the number and the activity appears there. If you don't want to see it anymore you double click it. If you want to see all the activities you press the date and if you want to clear everything you press the clear button. The only thing I wish is that I further developed the buttons so that they also controlled the tool tips/activities as well. </p>

                                <p>Trello is a website that is used for collaborative projects. The user is able to leave notes, contact certain people, upload files and remove files, and create new projects. Trello is a really good website as it allows users to see everything that everyone is doing, which allows for easy communication between team members, which is very important when there are multiple parties involved in a project.</p>

                                <p>The user interaction is very much based on sticky notes while maintaining a organizational filing system. Each list is a broad topic that the team member can see. Within that the user can add cards to the bottom in order to create subcategories. The team members can add files accordingly to each card or list to move the project along. The person is able to see if a task is done with list statuses that say completed, paused for input, and so forth. The right side is a thread of all the messages that have been written. </p>

                                <p>Overall Trello is a very easy site to use for collaborative projects. It does not get too crowded nor does it make everything hard to find. It is a very organized cite in terms of this type of usability. It alerts you through email when someone calls for you and finding where you are needed is also easy to find. Overall Trello has a very good system, it does what it is made to do.</p>

                            <img src="../images/tumblr.PNG" class="imageResize">
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Tumblr is a blogging website that allows users to create and share content with other users. The bloggers can share media such videos, audio files, pictures, links and text posts. Users can also create and design their own blog pages, which people can follow for content. Users can also communicate with each other through submissions, chat, asks and fan mail.</p>



                                <p>In terms of user friendliness, the scale is unfortunately not as great as it should be. The staff keeps changing graphic and UX/UI aspects that do not necessarily need changing. They try to hide menus and change button designs to be more minimalistic, but do not help in terms of usability. </p>

                                <p>In order to counter Tumblr&#8217;s useless updates, many people like myself, have downloaded extensions to help clean the mess. I personally use X-kit, which is a chrome extension that allows to customize my dashboard how I please. The screenshot of my dashboard shown above is not the same as it would be if you did not have X-kit. If I did not have this option, I would not recommend that you use Tumblr.</p>
